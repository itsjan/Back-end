title: "Express JS Crash Course ... continued"

I've started to work on my project and have put some basics in place.

I have started to build the data model with Mongoose. I've watched some additional videos, and searched documentation and samples on-line. I will be adding comments to my code to refenrence all the different sources that I have used. It is useful to have these "bookmarked" within the project for future reference, too. 

I will continue to watch the Crash Course on Express JS.

```js
members = [
    { id:1, name: 'John Doe', email: 'jd@email.com', status:'a'},
    { id:2, name: 'John Doe Sr', email: 'jd.sr@email.com', status:'a'},
    { id:2, name: 'John Doe Jr', email: 'jd.jr@email.com', status:'a'},
]

app.get('/api/members', (req, res) => {
    res.json(members);
});
```

```res.json``` sends JSON data. The response has ContentType set to ```application/json```

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Powered-By: Express
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 202

[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "jd@email.com",
    "status": "a"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "John Doe Sr",
    "email": "jd.sr@email.com",
    "status": "a"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "John Doe Jr",
    "email": "jd.jr@email.com",
    "status": "a"
  }
]

```

I am using VS Code REST Client (humao.rest-client) instead of Postman. I can store my API call samples together with the project files.

**req**


   docs REQ  
- https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req
- https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage


**req.body** 

https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req

By default `undefined`, populated by using body-parsin middleware such as `express.json` or `express.urlencoded()`

- docs https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#express.urlencoded
- https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#express.json


**moment**

[Should be replaced with a modern alternative.](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/)

I finished building the API functionality.

Next time, add view engine:
