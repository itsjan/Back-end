Today I will be finishing the tutorial and will be adding a view engine to the project. This project is using handlebars.

- https://handlebarsjs.com/
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars

We also added Bootstap which is a front-end toolkit.

I found this useful jQuery plugin which can add sorting and filtering to HTML tables.

I wanted to test it on my app. I got this to work, but realised that I will need to figure out how to insert page specific scripts within the main template. We only had {{{ body }}} but I needed to add stuff to the bottom of the page.

This [article](https://wolfgang-ziegler.com/blog/a-scripts-section-for-your-handlebars-layout-template) has the solution to my problem.
