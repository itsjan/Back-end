I'm taking a small break from the course materials and watching some node.js tutorials on [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/).

I've learned about the history of node.js and apparently it was a sort of controversial approach to server-side development at first. JavaScript on the server side? Anyone?

This tutorial I am watching is building an app without any npm dependencies:
- building a router
- building a config system
- building an API
- building an HTTP and an HTTP server ...
