# YOUR-BARISTA

## Project Background and Inspiration

This is a Backend-server API project for a Coffee Shop wishing to provide a subscription service for all hot drinks (coffee, tea, hot chocolate) for a fixed monthly fee.

This inspiration to this project came from PRET and their [YourPret Barista](https://www.pret.co.uk/en-GB/your-pret) Coffe Subscription Service.

### The Business Process

This is how the service works:

1. *Sign up* and we'll send your unique QR code via email

2. *Download* to your mobile wallet or save your email so it's ready to go

3. *Order* your drink from our lovely teams and scan your QR code at the till. Enjoy!

### Business Rules

You can use up to *5 times a day* (with *one redemption every 30 minutes*).

## Installing from Source and Running the Project Locally.

This assumes that MongoDB is installed and running locally as a service. Also, node and npm need to be installed.

1. Clone this repo
2. `npm i` - install dependencies
3. `npm run dev` - Run a development instance.

# The Back-End Process

The following section will document the sequence of API calls to the back-end server required in order to:


1. **Register a new membership**. Membership contains information about the expriry date and time, which is calculated as 30 days from the time of activation. Membership also contains the qr_code value used to redeem drinks.

2. Repeats every time the customer places an order, and redeems it with the membership:
   1.  **Register a drink order**. An orders is sent to the back-end server when the customer holding a membership wants to acquire a free drink. 
   2.   **Redeem the drink** Once the customer's QR code is scanned, it is sent to the server together with the order_id to check the the membership is valid.
