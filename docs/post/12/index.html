		<p>I have been working a couple of days on my new project, which is to solve a realistic business problem.</p>
<p>This is a server app/API for a Coffee Shop, which sells monthly coffee memberships.</p>
<p>For a single montly payment, the customer gets free coffee up to the following limits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Max 5 drinks per day</li>
<li>One redemption in any 30 minutes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given this is a very simple problem to solve; I have already ran into issues with complexity called <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/callback_hell">callback-hell</a>.</p>
<h2 id="promises">Promises</h2>
<p>I learned about how promises work, as I knew this can make the source code more easy to read and maintain.</p>
<p>The prescribed course tutorials use callbacks entirely. I realised that I will have to restructure my code to use Promises to keep it more maintainable.</p>
<h2 id="mongoose-models">Mongoose Models</h2>
<p>In order to keep my code clean, I needed to implement many virtual fields to my Mongoose models. I also learned how these are (and are not) populated when Mongoose returns queried data.</p>
<h2 id="making-my-project-more-simple">Making my project more simple</h2>
<p>I have rescoped and redefined the <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/product#English">MVP</a> several times during this project to keep to my budget and schedule. However, I do want to keep and implement the business rules (requirements) that I set for myself and the final project.</p>
